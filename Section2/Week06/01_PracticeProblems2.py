# 1. Write a loop that adds up the numbers between a start number and an end number.  The numbers can be constants or input from the user.



# 2. Write a program that accepts two separate inputs from the user.  One being a road speed limit and one being the speed of a car.  If the car is speeding, print out a message to the user that they are speeding.  If they are not speeding, print out a message that they are not speeding.  If they are speeding, also print out the amount they are speeding by.  
# - The fine will be $10 per km over the limit
# - if they are 15 over the limit they will lose 3 demerit points from their license.  
# - if they are 30 over the limit they will lose 4 demerit points from their license.
# - if they are 45 over the limit they will lose 5 demerit points from their license.
# - if they are 50 over the limit they will lose 6 demerit points from their license, have their license suspended for 30 days and have their car impounded for 7 days.


# 3. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number.  The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number.  For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.  You do NOT need to use recursion for this problem.
