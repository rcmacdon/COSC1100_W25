Recreate Tuesdays Golf score application with the following changes (remember the source code is available on GitHub):
1) There are 2 players
2) Scores will be entered by the user for each hole.
3) The game is a skins game, meaning that:
- the player that gets the best score on a hole wins the hole and gets 1 point.  
- If 2 players tie, the hole is carried over and the player who individually wins the next hole gets 2 points, (or 3 points if the previous 2 holes were held over) 
- The overall winner will be the player whom gets the most points.
4) At the end, output a list of holes, the score each player got, par, and the type of score the player got according to the following data:
    -3 - albatross
    -2 - eagle
    -1 - birdie
     0 - par
    +1 - bogie
    +2 - double bogie
