Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) is a law that was passed in 2005 by the government of Ontario, Canada. The purpose of the AODA is to make Ontario accessible by 2025. This includes making websites and software accessible to people with disabilities.

# ----------------------------------------------------
# AODA has 4 main components that effects UI Design

'''
1. Font Choice - English as a Second Language (Readability)
2. Tab Order - Keyboard Navigation
3. Tooltips - Screen Readers for the Visually Impaired
4. Colour Choice - Contrast - Colour Blindness

For the most part: 1, 2, and 4 are covered automatically by most UI frameworks. However, 3 is not.
